FLightR
=======

here will be a source code for R package FLightR
The scope of the package is to position animal using data from solar geolocation archival tags
the package is far from the release...

---------------	
to install the package try:
    
    require("devtools")
    install_github("eldarrak/FLightR@towards_0.4")
	library(FLightR)

the help files and vignette for the package are still to come :(

BUT - there is an example available in examples!
